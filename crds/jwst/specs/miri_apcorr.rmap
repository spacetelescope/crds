This file contains the aperture correction values for correcting observed
signal values within a finite aperture to an estimated total signal for the
source.  The correction is filter dependent and aperture dependent for imaging,
and for spectroscopy is also wavelength and possibly order dependent.

For imaging the aperture correction file will be a FITS table with columns
FILTER, PUPIL, EEFRACTION, RADIUS, APCORR, SKYIN, and SKYOUT.  The FILTER and
PUPIL values are strings.  The EEFRACTION is a floating point value larger
than 0.0 and less than 1.0 that gives the fractional signal within the circular
aperture for the PSF without any background.  The RADIUS value is the extraction
aperture radius value in pixels for this EEFRACTION, a floating point number.
The APCORR value is a multiplicative correction (floating point number) that
scales the observed signal to infinite aperture, and so is a value greater
than 1.0.  The APCORR value includes a correction for the sky background
subtraction, so the APCORR value is slightly smaller than the inverse of the
EEFRACTION value.  The SKYIN and SKYOUT values are the inner and outer radii
of the sky estimation area, in pixels.  Both these are floating point values.
Currently in general these SKYIN and SKYOUT values are specific to the
FILTER and PUPIL values and are not different for the various EEFRACTION
values, but that may change in the future (i.e. for MIRI where the sky
background can be large at the longer wavelengths).

Note: the format of the spectroscopic apcorr files has not yet been finalized,
the following is the initial set of values discussed, but these may change
as more discussion takes place.

For spectroscopy the aperture correction file will generally be a FITS table
with columns FILTER, PUPIL (NIRISS and NIRCam) or SUBARRAY (MIRI) or one of
GRATING (NIRSpec IFU and MOS) or SLIT (NIRSpec fixed slit), ORDER (used only
for the NIRISS WFSS mode), NELEM, WAVELENGTH, HEIGHT, APCORR, SKYIN, and
SKYOUT.  The latter three values are floating point arrays of length given
by the integer value NELEM.  Wavelengths are in microns, HEIGHT is the slit
extraction width in arc-seconds analgous to the RADIUS value for imaging,
and the APCORR value is a multiplicative correction factor greater than or
equal to 1.0.  For spectroscopy the sky background subtraction is generally
assumed to be carried out prior to the spectroscopic extractions, such as
using a background image or a scaled background template.  Nonetheless there
is the option for the SKYIN and SKYOUT values to be specified as a function
of wavelength.  The SKYIN and SKYOUT values are in pixels by assumption, and
are measured in cross dispersion direction on both sides of the spectrum.
If the two values are identical, no background subtraction needs to be carried
out.  [The definition of SKYIN and SKYOUT for spectroscopy requires further
discussion.]

For the case of MIRI/MRS the aperture correction values will be given as a
two-dimensional floating point image of dimensions 1032x1024 pixels, analogous
to the photometric calibration reference file.  As with the other modes the
aperture correction values will be multiplicative corrections greater than or
equal to 1.0.
