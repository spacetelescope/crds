Thus, these values        HISTORY   represent offsets to be made to the zeropoint of the                  HISTORY   'reference' dispersion relation.  These offsets must take into        HISTORY   account any on-board aperture centering slews as defined in the       HISTORY   SIAF.  Those centering slews are updated whenever the locations       HISTORY   of the given aperture's center (or reference pixel) in the            HISTORY   detector focal plane is remeasured (or redefined).  The image         HISTORY   of a point source 'slewed' to the V2,V3 position directed by          HISTORY   the SIAF table for a given aperture, should end up centered at        HISTORY   the given reference pixel on the detector.

HISTORY                                                                         HISTORY        In the fall of 1997 inflight measurements of the STIS            HISTORY   aperture positions and recalculation of the aperture centers in       HISTORY   conjunction with an FGS to FGS re-alignment led to revision of        HISTORY   all the aperture centering slews (SIAF 25.0).  These changes          HISTORY   were accounted for in a revised stsdas.calstis APD table,             HISTORY   hbp11488o_apd.fits.  However, the SIAF 25.0 slews also included       HISTORY   a revision to account for the decision to set all of the large        HISTORY   'imaging' apertures, except the 50CORON, to be concentric(same        HISTORY   reference pixel) with the 0.2X0.2.  Except for the F25MGII            HISTORY   filter, the hbp11488o_apd.fits table did not account for that         HISTORY   aspect of the changes in the SIAF.  Using that table would yield      HISTORY   incorrect wavelengths for spectra taken with any of the large,        HISTORY   25" and 50", apertures (except F25MGII and 50C0RON).

Thus,            HISTORY   the new entries are all 0.0 except for the F25NDQ.                    HISTORY                                                                         HISTORY        The old F25NDQ entry was actually for F25NDQ1.  Besides          HISTORY   changing the offset entry to be with respect to the 0.2X0.2 we        HISTORY   change the name to match the entry.  No spectral observations in      HISTORY   filters F25NDQ1-4 are expected during the epoch covered by this       HISTORY   table.  Unless pipeline changes since summer 1997 alter the           HISTORY   result, their data headers would all contain the same aperture        HISTORY   name F25NDQ, and stsdas.calstis will refuse to proceed when it        HISTORY   does not find a matching aperture name in this table. An aperture     HISTORY   throughput ISR expected out in the winter of 1999 should contain      HISTORY   any information needed in order to wavelength calibrate F25NDQ*.
