HISTORY  However, if the OBSMODE did not contain an MJD, the previous version ofHISTORY  the throughput file was used instead.  It appears that the previous verHISTORY sion of the script which generated the TMC was able to have the same filHISTORY e used for two different values of COMNAME (e.g., acs_wfc_ccd1_mjd_021_sHISTORY yn.fits for both acs_wfc_ccd1_mjd and acs_wfc_ccd1); it may have has somHISTORY ething to do with the values of INNODE and OUTNODE in the TMG.  The currHISTORY ent version of the script depends only on the value of the COMPNAME keywHISTORY ord, resulting in only the _mjd COMPNAME entry for ACS in the TMC being HISTORY updated.  The files being delivered are copies of their _mjd counterpartHISTORY s, with the COMPNAME for each of the files being: acs_wfc_ccd1, acs_wfc_HISTORY ccd2, and acs_hrc_ccd.
